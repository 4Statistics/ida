# Basic R objects

In R, everything is an object. The list of objects in memory `ls()` is an object itself, as shown in the example below, which wipes all objects from the workspace:
  
```{r clear-workspace, eval=FALSE}
rm(list=ls());
```

We're going to use data from the Small Arms Survey on civilian firearms. The data are based on [various sources](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-9.pdf) that illustrate how careful we should generally be about the reliability of our data.
