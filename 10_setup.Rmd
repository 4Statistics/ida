# 1. Setup

As mentioned in the introductory pages, this course uses R, a free and open source software used by data analysts in many different contexts. The first fifteen minutes of this Google Tech Talk by [Hadley Wickham](http://had.co.nz/) explains why use R for data analysis:

In the next pages, we explain how to set up R and RStudio for the course. Before we do that, let's review the other tools that you will need to use in this class.

## Computer equipment

You will need to bring a fairly recent laptop to class. Do not forget to bring your battery charger, as well as a USB stick in case the wifi fails us or if we have to share large files.

We can offer support for Mac OS X and Windows computers, as well as standard Linux distributions. It should be possible to run the course on all these platforms.

Recent computers run 64-bit processors, but it should also be possible to run the course on a 32-bit processor. More details when we install RStudio.

It is recommended that you use a laptop with a decent amount of disk space and memory. 'Mini' laptops can unfortunately be fairly restrictive in these regards.

## Internet browsers

The course requires that you use a modern and secure browser like [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Everything but Microsoft Internet Explorer should do.

Some browsers modify the names of the files that you download when their extension is unrecognized. If your browser adds `.txt` at the end of `.r` script files, rename them to just `.r`.

## Course material

Some of the files for this course will reach you through [ENTG group 58101](http://entg.sciences-po.fr/nui/virtualoffice.jsp#tool=docs&folderoid=11529888), so make sure that you have ENTG access and check the course emails for what to download from there.

By the end of the course, you will be able to download the final version of all the course pages from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/briatte/ida). [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform.

## Gist and RPubs

GitHub also offers [Gist](https://gist.github.com/), a handy way to share code. We will use it in class to share code "snippets" -- short bits of code to prepare data or draw a plot.

You can use Gist anonymously, or create an account and join the [`ida13`](https://github.com/ida13) organization. [Creating a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?return_to=gist) is free and makes finding your code much easier than if you do not register.

Finally, we might play a bit with [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/) if we get to the point of publishing projects. RPubs is a straightforward publishing platform that can be operated [directly from RStudio](http://youtu.be/XqzHnYLr5BE). Maybe laterâ€¦

## Google accounts

Finally, if you have a [Google account](https://www.google.com/accounts/), this will be useful to use tools like [Google Documents](https://docs.google.com/) or [Google Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/fusiontables).
