# 3.1. Functions

Suppose that you find yourself doing the same computation over and over again. You do not want to type the whole calculations every time you need: you want to program a function that does the job for you.

Take a basic example: the `sum` command adds a vector of numbers together.

```{r sum}
# Create a vector of 99 random [0,1] values.
x <- runif(9)
# Check result: show first 5 values.
head(x)
# Add them up.
sum(x)
```

```{r add-function}
add <- function(x,y) {
  x + y
}

sum(2,4)
```


## Basic examples

## `apply` functions

Loops are fantastic but can become memory-intensive. R also offers [`apply` functions](http://badhessian.org/loops-matrices-and-apply-functions/) that can usually do what you might want to do with a loop.
