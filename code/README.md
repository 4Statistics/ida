This folder contains the raw R code for the course, extracted from the R Markdown pages. The exercise scripts `1_` to `9_` are cited in the practice pages `013_`, `023_` etc.

A few extra scripts are bundled with the course: `4_twitter` is a script by David Ruau (updated to ROAuth), and `vwreg` should get in there soon.
