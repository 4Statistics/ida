# Addition.
1 + 2
# Brackets.
(1 + 2) / 3
# Exponentiation.
7^2



# A simple logical test with the natural logarithm.
log(1) > 0
# Guess why this result differs from the one above.
log(1) >= 0
# Note that equality requires two equal signs.
log(1) == 0
# A more complex example with scientific notation.
1 + log10(1e7) == 8*exp(1)^0



# Define a sequence of integers.
x <- c(1:3)
# Show object x.
x
# Compute its sum.
sum(x)
# Compute its product.
prod(x)
# Compare both on the fly.
sum(1:3) == prod(1:3)
