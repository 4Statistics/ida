# 12. Data-driven advances

> Today's session is a bit special: we have guests. For our final session, we'll have a journalist, a political scientist and a member of the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/) come and talk to us about what they do with data, how they do it, and why this concerns you. Below are a few introductory words.

## Better formats

## Better access

APIs, World Bank open data.

CVS, Github.

## Better graphics

Google Motion Charts, [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/), and [building your own web applications](http://blog.ouseful.info/2012/12/04/more-shiny-goodness-tinkering-with-the-ergast-motor-racing-data-api/) using [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/). Things are changing quickly in this area, which is under [active policy development](http://blog.ouseful.info/2012/12/12/this-week-in-open-and-communications-data-land/) in many (rich) countries.
