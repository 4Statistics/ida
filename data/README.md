# README

The `data` folder hosts a few demo datasets. Most data for the course is downloaded on the fly as the course goes.

* `grades.txt`: anonymized student grades from a math course
* `assange.txt`: a speech by Julian Assange
* `nhis.txt`: an extract from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey

Much more to come here. __Work in progress!__
