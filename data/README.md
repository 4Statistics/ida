Some stuff gets scraped from Wikipedia and is not saved.

(*) Files marked with an asterisk required heavy preprocessing or authentification to download, and are self-contained to the course. All other files were first downloaded in their native format and then saved as plain text comma-separated values. The data preparation code appears in the course pages.
