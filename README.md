# README

This is meant to turn into a course during spring 2013. [The syllabus is here](ida/raw/master/syllabus.pdf). The course is taught with [Ivaylo Petev](http://ipetev.org/).

## HOWTO

* `knitr` geeks: the course is meant to fly as HTML. Compile by running `index.Rmd`. [The result is here](http://f.briatte.org/teaching/ida/), frequently updated.
* `.Rprofile` nerds: [check the code](https://github.com/briatte/ida/blob/master/.Rprofile). I have coded a few things to help students with packages and data exploration.
* Typography nerds: all documents require [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/webfonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Open+Sans) and [Signika Negative](https://www.google.com/webfonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Signika+Negative) from Google Web Fonts.

The course also uses a few files from the `code/` and `data/` folder. Most documents can be downloaded on the fly if needed.

Everything got done on a MacBook Air running OS X 10.8, using Chrome, GitHub, R and RStudio, with some help from Terminal and TextMate.

## VERSION

Not even alpha. You can barely browse the draft pages so far, and I'm not even sure I have the best `knitr` routine to put it all together.

Nothing is tidy yet.

I am *very* open to suggestions.

## DONE

- Pages: introduction; sessions 1--2.
- Navigation: all files have been chained to each other.
- Startup: `.Rprofile` contains a package installer/loader utility.

## TODO

- Code: send `code/` files to `source_gist`. Acknowledge authors [started in `code/README` file].
- Code: finish the whole damn thing.
- Course: set up homework (exercises, assignments, grading scheme).
