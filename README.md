# README

This is meant to turn into a course during spring 2013. [The syllabus is here](syllabus.pdf).

## HOWTO

__For `knitr` geeks:__ the course is meant to fly as HTML. Compile by running `index.Rmd` after changing the `run-course` chunk to `EVAL=TRUE`, then open [index.html](syllabus.html) locally in any decent browser.

__You need to run the `.Rprofile`__ contained in the directory to define some of the functions found in the rest of the material. The course also uses files from the `code/` and `data/` folder.

## VERSION

Not even alpha. I would be surprised if anything works so far.

I am *very* open to suggestions at that stage, especially since I could not get the CSS file to be automatically included in the HTML rendering.

## TODO

- Finish the whole damn thing.
- Publish online.
