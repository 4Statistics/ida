# 4. Basic data operators

There is a growing number of online interfaces for data repositories. Have a look, for instance, at [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) and [Data Market](http://datamarket.com/), at [my links](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/wiki/data) or at [Moritz Marbach's links](https://delicious.com/moritz.marbach/data). A very successful interface is the [Gapminder](http://factbased.blogspot.fr/2012/07/convenient-access-to-gapminder-datasets.html) project, which relies on UN data and motion (animated) charts.

The basic point of today's session will be to open the QOG Basic dataset, and to check whether you can all download data for this course.

Later on, we'll have a look at [World Bank](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/WDI) datasets (see their [methodology](http://data.worldbank.org/about/data-overview/methodologies) of measurement), and we'll merge QOG and WDI data. Use the `countrycode` package if you need more country code classifications.
