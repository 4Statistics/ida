# Readings

This section documents the list of handbooks and optional readings that you can find in the course syllabus. We cover [online help](03_links.html) and [internal R documentation](13_help.html) at later stages.

Handbook chapters are assigned weekly to establish a learning baseline, and independent study of online material is greatly encouraged. Do not expect to become an expert (we are not): just learn as much as you can.

## Course handbooks

- Winston Chang, *[R Graphics Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do)* (O'Reilly 2012)
- Robert Kabacoff, *[R in Action](http://www.manning.com/kabacoff/)* (Manning 2011)
- Paul Teetor, *[R Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596809164.do)* (O'Reilly 2011)

Handbook chapters should be read *after* each course session.

The O'Reilly cookbooks cost about $30 / €30 / £20 each, depending on whether you buy the electronic or paperback formats. We recommend going digital to save trees and be able to search the book.

Both cookbooks are great, but only Teetor is absolutely necessary for this course. Kabacoff is a good complement to Teetor. We will distribute some relevant chapters as weekly readings throughout the course.

## Additional readings

- Larry Pace, *[Beginning R](http://www.apress.com/9781430245544)* (Apress 2012)
- Timothy Urdan, *[Statistics in Plain English](http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415872911/)* (Routledge 2010)
- Nathan Yau, *[Visualize This](http://book.flowingdata.com/)* (Wiley 2011)

Pace covers R programming up to more advanced statistical analysis with simulation and package development; Urdan covers essential statistics; and Yau is a guided tour to data visualization.

Finally, these books go further than what we will explore, but serve as good examples of what you can learn to do with slightly more advanced computing and visualization skills:

- Norman Matloff, *[The Art of R Programming](http://nostarch.com/artofr.htm)* (No Starch Press 2011)
- Edward Tufte, *[The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)* (Graphics Press 2001)
- Hadley Wickham, [ggplot2. Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](http://ggplot2.org/book/) (Springer 2009)
