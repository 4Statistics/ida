# 4. Basic data operators
  
There is a growing number of online interfaces for data repositories. Have a look, for instance, at [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) and [Data Market](http://datamarket.com/), at [my links](https://github.com/briatte/srqm/wiki/data) or at [Moritz Marbach's links](https://delicious.com/moritz.marbach/data). A very successful interface is the [Gapminder](http://factbased.blogspot.fr/2012/07/convenient-access-to-gapminder-datasets.html) project, which relies on UN data and motion (animated) charts.

Let's open the QOG Basic dataset.

Let's now have a  look at [World Bank](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/WDI) datasets (see their [methodology](http://data.worldbank.org/about/data-overview/methodologies) of measurement).

Finally, let's merge QOG and WDI data.

Use the `countrycode` package if you need more country code classifications.
