There's tons of tutorials out there. [Here's a good one](https://files.nyu.edu/dm141/public/tutdoc/R_intro/html/Introduction%20to%20R.xhtml#magicparlabel-1311). [Here's another good one](http://compdiag.molgen.mpg.de/ngfn/docs/2003/jan/R-intro.pdf).

In addition to R tutorials, there are [blogs](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) and [online communities](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) where R users can share [questions and answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) about the software. Most of the examples that we will see in class were first found [online](http://www.statsblogs.com/) on stats blogs often run by R enthusiasts.

The visualization component of the course can be explored through [Alberto Cairo's selection of resources](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2012/10/recommended-readings-for-infographics.html) in that area, which branches with infographics and computer science. The most passionate are also referred to John P. Boyd's teaching notes on [Scientific Visualization and Information Architecture](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jpboyd/ENG503.html).

The [SRQM](http://srqm.tumblr.com/) blog, created for another course, does its best to deliver a regular amount of illustrated links on statistical analysis for the social sciences as well as on data visualization and other related themes.
