## 10.3. Google Maps

We have a special guest today, so the practice is for your pure enjoyment at home. The techniques described below require a [Google account](http://www.google.com/accounts/). Let's hope they don't "retire" that service too, because Google has a ton of useful tools for mapping stuff.

## Intensity maps

The easiest tool is probably the [intensity map](http://www.gastonsanchez.com/projects/crunching-data/intensity-map), which takes less than five minutes to produce, using a Google Fusion Table.

[Quick maps from Google Charts data](http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/2011/02/using-r-to-map-with-google-chart-tools/) and [Google Maps API control](http://andy.egge.rs/research.html).

- From [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/)...
- ... to [Google Motion Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/motionchart) ...
- ... to [Google Motion Charts in R](https://code.google.com/p/google-motion-charts-with-r/).

An example with [life expectancy](http://lamages.blogspot.fr/2012/03/change-in-life-expectancy-animated-with.html). Note: you have to allow your browser to load 'insecure' Flash content to see the results. In Google Chrome, click the shield icon shown in the right segment of your address bar.
